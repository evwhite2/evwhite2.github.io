                    Aspiring Full Stack developer working to move the trajectory of my career towards a company with a conscious. I have a BAS in Environmental Sustainability and am in active pursuit of my MBA. I am inclined towards the principles of continuous improvement, and I use my fresh experience with the many suites we will learn in Bootcamp to do just that.
                <br> <br>
                    I have contributed to the design and implementation of small-scale data tools to help my previously organization make more effective choices on a front-line basis. With several years of advanced customer service experience in leadership roles, I enjoy and excel in having an active line of communication with the client, providing me with the ideal combination of flexibility, emotional intelligence, and diligence to quickly and reliably. The cherry on top is my life-long obsession with art and design that is both practiced and preached to the delight of all those who observe.
